R source code files and CSV data files for the HCI Handbook chapter "Experiment Design and Statistical Analysis in Human-Computer Interaction" by Jacob O. Wobbrock, Ph.D.

This Github repository contains the R source code files and CSV data files for the HCI Handbook (4th ed., CRC Press, 2026) chapter by Jacob O. Wobbrock. The R files appear in the R directory and the CSV files in the data subdirectory. The R code is written to read in the CSV files assuming they are in the data subdirectory. The R source code reads in the CSV files and performs various statistical analyses on them. The HCI Handbook chapter has excerpts from these R source code files and their output. The reader is strongly encouraged to open the R source code files and step through them while reading the HCI Handbook chapter.
