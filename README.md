R source code files and CSV data files for the HCI Handbook chapter by Jacob O. Wobbrock

This Github repository contains the R source code files and CSV data files for the HCI Handbook (4th ed., CRC Press, 2025) chapter by Jacob O. Wobbrock. The R files appear in the R directory and the CSV files in the data subdirectory. The R code is written to read in the CSV files assuming they are in a data subdirectory. The R source code reads in the CSV files and performs various statistical analyses on them. The HCI Handbook chapter has excerpts from this R source code and its resultant output. It is recommended that the reader open the R source code and execute it while reading the chapter.
